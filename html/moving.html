                The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening 
                festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private 
                performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. 
                Very clever were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter boats covered 
                with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armor covered with 
                the same useful diamond shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of preserve pots were cut out. The big chamber was the scene 
                of many innocent revels.

                No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her heart's content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of 
                russet leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed 
                doublet once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness 
                of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved 
                some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of various costumes, 
                and managing the stage besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many hours 
                which otherwise would have been idle.
