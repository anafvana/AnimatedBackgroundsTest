# Still vs. Animated Background Test
This repository is part of a project developed in Human Computer Interaction. 
It contains a minimal website whose purpose is to calculate the difference in reading time when the background is still versus moving.
The absence of any elements but the bare minimum is intentional: we want to minimise interference.

Both snippets used on the website come from Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott, and are exactly 260 words long.
